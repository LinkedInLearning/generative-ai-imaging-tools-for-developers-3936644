## Course Description

Consumers and businesses across the world are increasingly recognizing the power of AI imaging systems like DALL-E. But how do you successfully integrate these tools into your everyday workflow if you’re a developer or a software architect? In this hands-on course, instructor Ronnie Sheer covers the essentials of incorporating AI image generation into professional applications. Explore ways to leverage some of today’s most-talked-about imaging tools and open-source APIs, including how to set up and run DALL-E, the Stability AI API, and Stable Diffusion on Google Colab. Test out your new skills along the way in the interactive exercises at the end of each section. This course requires basic proficiency in programming and application development, and previous experience with Python is a plus.
